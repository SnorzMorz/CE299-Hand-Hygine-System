# Marketing Plan

This is the marketing plan of IDeal Hygiene for its first product - Hand Hygiene Monitoring system.

## Customers

* We target SMEs that can't or don't want to afford a high-cost Hand hygiene monitoring system but still feel the need to have it.
* Example: Small to medium-sized beauty salon and manufacturer.

## Economics

![MarketValue](https://cseegit.essex.ac.uk/2020_ce299/ce299_team06/-/raw/master/Final_Product/images/market_value.png)
* The hand hygiene solution market grows sharply since last year, especially under the tension of epidemic. 
The medical industry started import hand hygiene monitoring systems for a better health care system. 
Frost & Sullivan’s recent analysis, "the hand hygiene solution market is expected to grow from $1.47 
billion in 2018 to $1.98 billion in 2023 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.2%". 
Many other reports also point out the same thing. The research also shows the large enterprise like Ecolab, 
BioVigil Healthcare, GOJO Industries and etc. has already prepared to lead the market.

* Hence, Our product currently is not looking for becoming the major factor of the market. Our product hopes to have
a different target customer from those large enterprises. Being their partner instead of their competitor is an 
alternative way. For example, join or become the hand hygiene system developer of those hand hygiene monitoring 
system retailers. We can even save up the effort of marketing but put the effort to find the partner that is easier 
to be identified.

* There is already some popular enterprise providing hand hygiene monitoring system in several ways. However, 
they are usually aiming for large organizations or groups such as hospitals of advanced countries. The market needs 
some hand hygiene monitoring systems that are straight, easy to understand, and affordable pricing for SMEs. 
Our main objective is to be the manufacturer of the IT system part in hand hygiene monitoring system and cooperate 
with the enterprise who want to be the service provider to product's consumer.   

* Although the concept of hand hygiene has started being popularized in 1985, the target market is significantly 
growing due to the rise of hand hygiene awareness after the Covid-19 pandemic. In the future, many industries
other than the medical industry only will also join the hand hygiene monitoring system market as demanders. 
For example, the food industry and beauty industry will be the next industry to join the market in the near 
future. It is believed that the manufacturing industry might be following.

* For another side, the trends of target market is looking for a way to make use utilizing the data collected 
by monitoring system. Some of them wants a combination of Monitoring system and Artificial Inteligent. 
For SMEs, they might not place the big data thing in the same priority as those large enterprise place. 
They wants new system that also can replace existed system, it could be a clock in/out system with hand
hygiene monitoring function, this can save the resource that allocated for clock in/out system.

* More precisely, we are aiming to serve the beauty industry located in Europe and Asia-Pacific. We are 
interested in exploit the market in other industries like the manufacturing industry since RFID is a very 
wide-used technology in the manufacturing industry. One of the plans is to make the product evolve this way 
in the future.
