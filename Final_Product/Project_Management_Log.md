# Project Management Log

## Project management discussion

Taking in to account the current situation, we think that the project has gone well. We have done the tasks that we set out to do: we made an easy to use website to track the dispenser usage, and we gave the user a lot of ways to analyze the usage using graphs and Machine Learning. However, we are confident that we did not work up to our full potential and that some mistakes and errors were in our control and slowed our progress. Such as the forgetfulness to update Jira or teammates missing out on meetings. Our communication was hindered by only being online through Zoom and Whatsapp. If we had the opportunity to get to know each other more by communicating in person, we would have less trouble with people not showing up to meetings or updating Jira.  On the bright side, the skills we have gained through only online communication will come in handy in future job prospects. As well as, online meetings allowed us to have more extended conversations about the project that otherwise we could have had since now most students have more free time.

## Burndown-Charts Discussion

Compared to our previous Sprints, we had a more difficult time following our Guideline for completing the issues. This is because of two reasons: fewer meetings, especially during the Winter break (Sprint 7), where there was a long break between the last update. During the Winter break, we had the issue that we never had everyone come to the meeting, which hindered our discussion and limited Jira updates. Secondly, we often forgot to update our tasks midway through a Sprint, which meant a sudden drop in remaining values, as seen at the end of Sprint 8 and 9. Besides that, Sprint 8  was probably our most productive effort because we followed the guidelines and did the most work based on the amount of Story Points. If we had to improve future Sprints, it would probably be a good idea to set a reminder for updating Jira daily or at least weekly.
