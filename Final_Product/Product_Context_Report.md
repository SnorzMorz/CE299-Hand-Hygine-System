# Product Context

## Health and Safety

Our product is mainly focused on ensuring human wellbeing on a daily basis. As our product wants to keep everyone safe, the implementation process and design is prioritized with humans’ health and safety. The whole product consists of hand sanitizer machines (hardware) and online monitor platform (software). 

The Hand Sanitizer Machine will be modified by us to enable every user to have a safe and nice experience whenever they use it. This machine will be designed to make sure users are able to use it with touchless technologies. This prevents every user from touching any part of the machine that might be harmful to the user. It also has the capability to update the database whenever a user uses the machine. The database will update the user, current time, location / department that stores every usage. 

Monitor Platform is a realtime online platform that enables customers(usually company’s executives) to monitor usage of hand sanitizer of every company employee/user. This monitor platform retrieves data usage of hand sanitizer for every user from the database. Both the sanitizer machine and monitor platform are connecting to the same database. In our monitor platform website, we have deployed a few nice and neat graphs to let our customer have more information about every user and usage. This allows our customers to have more insight about every user’s hygiene. We also provide functionality like categories between users who are good at maintaining personal hygiene and who are not. This can be applied as fast as a real-time system and enables customers to really take care of users’ personal health and safety.


## Ethical

In this digital era, trust is a complex issue that comes with existential threats to the company. While technologies are often viewed as vehicles for exponential growth, technology alone can’t build a long-term trust. Due to this, our organization is taking every possible approach to maintain the high level of thrust our stakeholders expect. Our ethical in technology product is addressing the approach to the use of technologies as a whole and how they are developed to drive our business strategy and operations. We are always evaluating how we can use technology in ways that are aligned with our fundamental purpose and core values.

Our product means to protect everyone on a daily basis and provide them confidence to continue serving the society. For users of our product, we consider proactively on how to make them feel comfortable and confident whenever they use our product. Every user will have a tag that enables our machine to synchronize their usage onto our database with touchless technology. This allows our system to grasp a better understanding of users’ usage for hand sanitizer. By evaluating these usage, our AI system able to provide information and any necessary advice for every user to protect their health	 and well-being. This means our system is collecting data from every synchronized hand sanitizer usage, including hand sanitizer machine ID, synchronized user and the exact time of the use. As an ethical product, we always ensure users’ data will be safe and confidential by having a great security on our database and our team to support on 24/7.

Until now, we have talked about users but it’s also important to our customer about the ethics of our product. Our customers will usually be executives of companies or organizations. We are transparent and provide as much information as we can to our customers about our product. To provide better service and health protection, it’s necessary to understand the organization’s physical work flow, number of workers, department layout and other important information. We would always have a specific design and set up for different organizations depending on their requirements, property and number of workers. It’s crucial for us as a product developer to be seriously handed and protect every details of information that’s customer has provided. This can be achieved with our customer system database. Our system has highly restricted security with the ability to filter any malicious attempt to access the system. We also have a high requirement of workers’ ability to keep credential information and also provide training for our worker to be highly secret about any important information.
