# Project Management Log

## Project management discussion


Given the current conditions, we think that that the team has worked well. Of course, the project would be progressing quicker if we could meet up in person as well as have access to the labs and the RFID reader. However, we think that the current complications will only help us in the future if we ever have to work from home. Through Zoom calls, we had the chance to continue our project from afar smoothly, but as not everyone is on the same Timezone, we only had a limited timeframe for meetings. We think that we would have better communication and teamwork if everyone had a webcam, this would help with simulating a real-world conversation and would help us open up.

We had a Scrum meeting every Tuesday as well as a bonus meeting in the labs on Fridays to report on the progress of assigned tasks. We concluded that it would be better not to have a Scrumamster each session but for everyone to add the task as they feel is necessary. Though this helped make sure that no job was left unadded, it also caused some confusion in the team. This is because a person would write a task, but the other team members would not be informed, or the tasks would not be descriptive enough for the other team members to understand it. This also caused duplicate tasks to be added, which complicated things further.

We kept communication to a minimum, given the current circumstances. As this is a first for us (communicating and doing a project only through Zoom with such a large group) at first, the communication was slow and forced, but as we opened up to each other, it improved. To further enhance the communication we think that it would be good to do something outside of the project such as meet up (when that is allowed) or do something online such as play videogames or chat.

Sadly we did not use standup meetings, but I think they would have helped since some of the scrum meetings took longer than necessary.

## Burndown-Charts Discussion

The first two Sprints (S1 and S2) do not show the progress that we made because we didn't add story points to tasks. We fixed this issue from S3. Even though we started adding Story points, we didn't accurately calculate the number of story points it would require to complete the tasks. We can see this in S3 and S5 as the amount of story points increases in the middle of the Sprint. In the future, we should try to more accurately predict the amount of work a task will take and leave time for unpredicted problems. Another problem that we will hopefully address in future Sprints is forgetting to update completed tasks except for right at the end of a Sprint. It makes it look like we rush the Sprint right before the deadline.
