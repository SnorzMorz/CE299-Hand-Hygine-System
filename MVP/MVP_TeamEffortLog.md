### Sprint 1 (University Week 4):

In sprint 1, we get grasp some concepts and ideas of the project option and discussion with company representative. After this, we decide with the project of **Hand Hygiene Monitoring**. We didn't actually create many issues with just a 1 hour discussion and we all try to search for any ideas on how the thing can work. I figure out that monitoring will require a website and that's the thing for me. This [website template](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/tryw3css_templates_analytics.htm) is what I found like a monitoring website.

### Sprint 2 (University Week 5):

I still haven't have any issue assign to me in Sprint 2. After the discussion with our Project Manager, I know that in the future we will need a database to store all data from the monitoring product and a website to show the data. I started to do as many research as I could for database server and hosting. By that time, our team still haven't have any ideas and lack of knowledge about server and local host. Even though I haven't tried to establish a database server or web hosting, I have spend my summer learning about Web Development. With this ability and knowledge, I know Google is providing free hosting and database which is [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/) and [Google Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/). However, I still doing research on what other platform that might provide more and better service with free. I end up going with [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/) and start with documentation.

### Sprint 3 (University Week 6):

*[Jira Issue 1](https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/A299114-18)*:
- It was set and finish in Sprint 3
- I have spend around an hour to read documentation about database server and establish the database server. The process of establish a server takes a long time and I also need to create and store all the username password is safe enough.

*[Jira Issue 2](https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/A299114-20)*:
- It was set and finish in Sprint 3
- It takes about 3 days to solve different connection problem among team member.
- This issue mainly to make sure that everyone of our team able to connect to the database. It didn't turn up to be a easy task as I am not aware of Public IP address needed for every single one of us to connect to the database server. In order to make sure that the database server is save enough, the person with username and password with the allowed Public IP address able to connect to the database server. It takes 1 day to do the research and helping team member to connect to the database.

### Sprint 4 (University Week 7):

*[Jira Issue 1](https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/A299114-35)*:
- I read all documentation and start a webservide hosting in an hour
- This issue was finish in the same sprint as it created.
- I started to create a web app service in Azure. In order to make a live website, I will need to have a webserver which azure provide. I also provide a name with azure domain. The webserver is using a git to save all the files and send everthing in git to the user who request the website.

*[Jira Issue 2](https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/A299114-36)*:
- I done this between 1 to 2 hour.
- This issue was finish in the same sprint as it created.
- After I have done the database server and web service, it seems like the website is ready to start building. However, I was wondering about the connection between database and website. I have tried few times and made some research and it end up working. What I did is to add the IP address of the website to the database, which is part of the secruity requirement.

*[Jira Issue 3](https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/A299114-14)*:
- I complete this task in total of 5 hours.
- This was create in sprint 4 and complete in next sprite
- I am the full-stack developer for our team. I started a simply UI design and template of each webpage. After I design how the webpage should look like, I used W3School CSS library to implement my design without spending too much time on Front-End. This allow me to work more on Back-End and also allow Christina to work from my design and she become part of the Front-End designer.

*Before I continue, I want to state out that I am interact with Azure website git and I will update GitLab less frequently compare to the web git. I can't provide the most relevant git permalink. https://ce299-team06.scm.azurewebsites.net:443/ce299-team06.git*

### Sprint 5 (University Week 8):

*[Jira Issue 1](https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/A299114-68)*:
- I have spent about 7 hours on this task
- It created on sprint 5 and complete in the same week
- I started using [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/) with PHP to deploy chart into the website. I can't retrieve data using JavaScript because I am not using Node.js instead I use PHP to retrieve data and pass it into JavaScript to store the data. Currently, I have made 2 types of chart which is usage of last 7days and 30days.

*[Jira Issue 2](https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/A299114-63)*:
- This task is done in about 3 to 4 hours
- It has done in the same sprint as it created
- After Christina redesign the website with plain HTML and CSS, I have to restructure it and turn them into PHP file. To make sure the best user experience, I have removed most of the duplicate code and fix some of the CSS design issues. I also tried to make sure the chart page fit the responsive design.

*[Jira Issue 3](https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/A299114-49)*:
- This task is done in the same sprint as it created and completed in an hour.
- I have started the research for a live search in website to search user in database without refreshing the whole page. This system can't be implement in the MVP product as I need more research on how to implement it.

We had to be able to simulate input into the database (which was created at this point), so I created the basis for our input system. - It did not perfectly simulate the input as it used userID to input data rather than using RFID to input data. 

### Sprint 5 (University Week 8):

I participated in the discussions about where to go in the future with the project and analysed the proposals in the team meeting. 

Link to task: https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/projects/A299114/issues/A299114-44  
This task was about creating visualisations that could be used on the website, that was focused more on a user specifically.
